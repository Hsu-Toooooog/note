# 解题方法汇总

### 方框图化简

其实就是连接点的前移或后移, 保证各回路不交叉来求解传递函数

### 梅森公式(Mason's Rule)求传递函数

1. 首先需要了解几个概念

   - **Loop**(回路):
     - A loop is a closed path that originates and terminates on the same node, and along the path no node is traversed twice.
   - **Forward path**(前向通道):
     - A forward path is a path in the signal flow diagram that connects the input to the output without touching any single node or path more than once.
   - **Independent nodes**(输入点)
     - Independent node represents independent variable and has only outgoing branches.
   - **Dependent nodes**(输出点)
     - Dependent node represents dependent variable and has only incoming branches.

2. Finding out 

3. 根据梅森公式求解
   

   ### $$T_{ij}=\frac{\sum_kP_{ijk}\Delta_{ijk}}{\Delta}$$

   

   1. $x_i$ is the input variable, $x_j$ is the output variable

   2. $T_{ij}$ is the transfer function
      

      #### $$T_{ij} = \frac{x_j(s)}{x_i(s)}$$

      

   3. $P_{ijk} = $ gain of the $k^{th}$ forward path from $x_i$ to $x_j$

   4. $\Delta = $ 1 **-** (sum of all different loop gains) **+** (sum of the gain products of all combinations of 2 non-touching loops) - (sum of the gain products of all combinations of 3 non-touching loops) + ...(回路增益乘积)

   5. $\Delta_{ijk} = $ $\Delta$ - $\sum$ (loop gains of the loops that touch the $k^{th}$ forward path)

      or we can define it another way:

      $\Delta_{ijk} = \sum$ (loop gains after removing $k^{th}$ forward path)
